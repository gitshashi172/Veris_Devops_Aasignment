(a)You have a predefined AMI selection process that's not covered in the playbook.
(b)You'll need to add specific configuration tasks for your chosen web server (Apache or Nginx) according to security best practices.
(c)For SSL/TLS setup and site security, additional configurations for your chosen web server are necessary, such as modifying virtual host/server
  block configurations and enabling HTTPS.
